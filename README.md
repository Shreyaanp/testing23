# Project README.md Overview

Welcome to our code repository! This README aims to provide a high-level overview of the project for developers and contributors.

## API Endpoints

Our project features several API endpoints to handle user interactions securely and efficiently:

- **Hello Endpoint**:
  - **GET** `/api/hello`: Returns a simple JSON greeting[0].

- **User Authentication**:
  - **POST** `/api/register`: Handles new user registrations by taking username, email, and password, and adding a new user to the database after password hashing[0].
  - **POST** `/api/login`: Authenticates users by comparing hashed passwords and returns a session token if successful[0].

## File Structure

The file structure of our project is generated dynamically using a script which recursively scans a given directory and outputs a JSON structure containing information about each file and directory[3]. Hereâ€™s an excerpt of our script functionality:

```javascript
function generateFileStructure(folderPath) {
  const items = fs.readdirSync(folderPath);
  // Logic to handle directories and files
}
const fileStructure = generateFileStructure('./path_to_directory');
```

## Key Components

- **Database Connection**:
  - The `dbConnect` function handles the connection pooling to MongoDB using environment variables for configuration[0].

- **User Model**:
  - Defines the User schema model for MongoDB using mongoose which includes fields like username, email, password, and creation date[0].

- **Authentication Logic**:
  - User password hashing and verification using `bcryptjs`[0].
  - Protected routes that check for valid session tokens before granting access[0].

- **Local Storage Hook**:
  - Custom React hook `useLocalStorage` for managing local storage state. This hook abstracts the complexities of synchronizing state with local storage[0].

- **Themes and Styling**:
  - Implementation of dark and light modes using another custom hook `useColorMode` which manages the theme state throughout the application[0].

- **Frontend Components**:
  - Reusable React components for UI including layouts, authentication forms, and other user interface elements .

By examining the structure and components detailed above, contributors should have a good starting point for understanding how the application is built and how to begin contributing to the project. If further information is needed, refer to the source code and the extensive comments therein.
